It's time for Rev2! This one is pretty similar to the first: once you get the inputs right to the program, you will get the flag. You don't need the shell server for this one, but the binary can be found at /problems/2018/rev2/ if you would like to run it there.

`Use flagCheck to input the flag you get from the challenge to get the actual flag`

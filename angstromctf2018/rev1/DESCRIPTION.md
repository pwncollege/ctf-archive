One of the commmon categories in CTFs is Reverse Engineering, which involves using a dissassembler and other tools to figure out how an executable file works. For your first real reversing challenge, here is an ELF file. Head over to /challenge on the shell server to try it out, and once you have the input right, get the flag!

`Note: Use sudo to run the binary as:`
```
sudo /challenge/binary_name
```

# ångstromCTF 2018

A capture-the-flag (CTF) competition hosted and organized entirely by alumni and current students of Montgomery Blair High School! CTF cybersecurity competitions have become an increasingly popular way for students to learn more about cybersecurity and develop and refine their hacking skills. These competitions are designed to educate and inspire high school students through interactive hacking challenges.<br>
The first ångstromCTF took place April 8-17, 2016. It was a phenomenal success, with almost 500 teams participating and submitting thousands of problem solutions. Since then, we've run a competition every year and grown to host more than 1,500 scoring teams. As we expand our competition to an even wider audience, our chief goal remains making our competition as accessible as possible to students with little to no background knowledge in hacking and cybersecurity.<br>
Students will compete in small teams. Points are given for answering each question (entering the flag). Prizes will be awarded to the top-scoring U.S. high-school teams.<br>
ångstromCTF is intended both for beginners and experienced CTFers and consists of questions ranging from simple to very difficult in various categories. There are five categories of problems:

- Binary Exploitation: Apply a range of skills to exploit security vulnerabilities in programs, such as buffer overflows, format string bugs, and heap vulnerabilities.
- Cryptography: Crack cryptographic systems ranging from classical ciphers to complex protocols with math and logic.
- Miscellaneous: Use anything from scripting language knowledge to forensic analysis to solve problems that don't fit into a rigorous category.
- Reverse Engineering: Examine compiled programs given to you and figure out their inner workings. These executables span everything between simple programs and purposely obfuscated code.
- Web Exploitation: Find various vulnerabilities in web pages, and use them to get access to areas you shouldn't. This topic covers a wide range of vulnerabilities, including SQL injections and cross-site scripting.

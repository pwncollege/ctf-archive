Artemis wants a copy of Windows, but she doesn't feel like paying for it. She decided to hack Microsoft's servers to generate a product key, and found their verification software, which runs on Linux for some reason. Can you get her a working product key (form ABCD-EFGH-IIJK-LMNO-PQRS-TUVW, each uppercase letter is a digit) using the email artemis.tosini@example.com and name Artemis Tosini?

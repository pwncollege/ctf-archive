# REHOSTING

Files can be found here: [DiceCTF Quals 2025](https://github.com/dicegang/dicectf-quals-2025-challenges/blob/main/crypto/vorpal-sword)

## Challenge Setup
This challenge uses `python` and does not require any dependecies.

## Flag
The `flag` existed in the environment when the ctf took place but `pwn.college` flag exists at `/flag` so changed the location from where `flag` is being extracted from.

My plaintext has been encrypted by an innocent friend of mine while playing around cryptographic libraries, can you help me to recover the plaintext , remembers it's just numbers and there's a space between some numbers which you need to remove the space and submit the recovered plain text as a flag.

`Use flagCheck to input the flag you get from the challenge to get the actual flag`

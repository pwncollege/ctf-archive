%  This file can be used to add custom PostScript code that you
%  wish to have executed at the beginning of every PostScript job
%  being distilled. If the option labelled "Use Prologue.ps and
%  Epilogue.ps" is selected in the "Advanced" panel of the "Job
%  Options" dialog, the contents of this file will be executed
%  before the actual PostScript file is run. This file is executed
%  when the "UsePrologue" parameter is set to "true" in the job
%  options file. This file is usually located in Distiller's "Data"
%  directory, but it may in fact reside anywhere in the same folder
%  or directory as the Distiller application. This file can be used
%  for a variety of purposes, including adding a cover page to a job
%  or for defining PostScript procedures for gathering statistics
%  while a PostScript job is executing.

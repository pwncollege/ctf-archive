% End-user startup PostScript job file.  Include any permanent PostScript into 
% this file.  This file will be executed as an "unencapsulated job"*
% each time the Acrobat Distiller application starts up.

% NOTE: This file will be overwritten each time you install Acrobat Distiller.
% We recommend you make a copy of this file to a different name and modify
% that copy.

% Each of the items below is presented as an example as is commented out. To
% actually use one of the examples, uncomment the line(s) of PostScript code by
% deleting the "%" character and modify to suit your needs.
%
% Please be aware that any PostScript code in this file which needs to access
% the filesystem must do so with fully qualified pathnames. Do not assume that
% a "current directory" exists.

%%% IDIOM RECOGNITION
%%% Idiom recognition enables the conversion of blends from
%%% popular software such as Illustrator, FreeHand, Quark, and
%%% Corel into Level 3 smooth shades.
%%% In Acrobat 4.0 it was recommended to set the IdiomRecognition
%%% flag in a startup file. But in Acrobat 5.0 and later, blends
%%% conversion is controlled by a distillerparam (/DetectBlends)
%%% in the job options file, and is settable from Distiller's
%%% user interface.

You have stolen the checking program for the CSAW Challenge-Response-Authentication-Protocol system. Unfortunately you forgot to grab the challenge-response keygen algorithm (libchallengeresponse.so). Can you still manage to bypass the secure system and read the flag?

Note: The challenge has one dependency missing which is how the challenge is set up.

`Use flagCheck to input the flag you get from the challenge to get the actual flag`

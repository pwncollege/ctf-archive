Hello there! I learnt C last week and already made my own SaaS product, check it out! I even made sure not to use compiler flags like --please-make-me-extremely-insecure, so everything should be swell.

Hint - The challenge server is running Ubuntu 18.04.

`Use flagCheck to input the flag you get from the challenge to get the actual flag`

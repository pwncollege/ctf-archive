## Welcome to PatriotCTF 2023

PatriotCTF is a beginner-friendly capture-the-flag competition hosted by GMU's cybersecurity club, MasonCC. All are welcome to participate, including students and security professionals. Challenges will range from beginner to expert, so there should be something for everyone. This is a jeopardy-style CTF, meaning there will be various challenges from the different categories described below.
- **Cryptography**: Code breaking, cipher smashing, and math that fights back!
- **Reverse Engineering**: Figuring out how things work, then breaking those things!
- **Pwn**: Good old-fashioned binary exploitation
- **OSINT**: Who's shooting those cyber bullets at me?
- **Forensics**: PCAPs and file carving and memory dumps (oh my!)
- **Web**: The attack surface of the modern world!
- **Misc**: Programming, Scripting, ML & more!

Hello,

I recently challenged a hacker to hack my site and it did not go very well :( We just got hacked and I have no idea what just happened. Apparently all user data has been leaked. Please find out what happened and help me out :(

`Use flagCheck to input the flag you get from the challenge to get the actual flag`

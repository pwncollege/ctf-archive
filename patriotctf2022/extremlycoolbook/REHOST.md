# REHOSTING

Files can be found here: [Extremely Cool Book](https://github.com/MasonCompetitiveCyber/PatriotCTF2022-Public/tree/main/Crypto/Extremely%20Cool%20Book)

## Challenge Setup
There are no dependency files for `server.py` or `ECB.py`. `ECB.py` is the original file with the flag, which is why we have converted that to a binary using pyinstaller

## Flag Check

As this challenge has its own custom flag so we use a simple flag check binary where the hacker can input the challenge flag and get the pwn.college flag. Command to run flag check-
```
/challenge/flagcheck
```

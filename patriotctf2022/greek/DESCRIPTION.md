The flag is the secret meeting location. I used strongs encryption with help from my favorite book.

Ciphertext: `2786 2532 4569 5221 1722 4172 490`

`WARNING!` This is not a technical challenge!

`Flag format: pctf{location}`

`Use flagCheck to input the flag you get from the challenge to get the actual flag`

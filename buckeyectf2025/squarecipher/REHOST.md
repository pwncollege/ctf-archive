Files can be found here: [BuckeyeCTF 2025](https://bctf-25-uploads.s3-us-east-2.amazonaws.com/950d53d8e08c897660fc8f1ebefb8e2fc357a03e76e3ded6eea567f78d2f5717/square_cipher.py)

## Challenge Setup
This challenge just contains a `python` file which has dependencies on other files provided so having them run with the same shebang or with the same python should be enough to run the challenge without any issues.

# REHOSTING

Files can be found here: [justCTF 2019](https://github.com/justcatthefish/justctf-2019/tree/master/challenges/ppc_rsa-exponent)

## Challenge Setup
The file `public.py` is dependent on the file named `private.py` which can be found in the same repository. Keeping `private.py` in the same directory as `public.py` should work.

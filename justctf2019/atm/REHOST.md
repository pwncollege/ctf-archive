# REHOSTING

Files can be found here: [justCTF 2019](https://github.com/justcatthefish/justctf-2019/tree/master/challenges/pwn_atm)

## Challenge Setup
There are no dependecy files for `atm` so it should work as intended.

## Flag Check
As this challenge has its own custom flag so we use a simple flag check binary where the hacker can inputs the challenge flag and get the pwn.college flag.
Command to run flag check-
```
/challenge/flagCheck
```

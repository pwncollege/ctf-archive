Someone told me that having plaintext in my code was insecure so I put it all in this file!

I don't think that one's valid...
Sorry, but that card appears to be invalid.
Regrettably, that card is invalid.
That doesn't look like a valid card.
Are you trying to get us caught?
Better luck next time!
Are you just guessing?
What's the problem? It can't be that hard.
Wrong!
Uh-oh try again.
Hey wait a minute, that one was valid!
You gotta do better. We can't be skipping good cards.
What do you mean? This one's definitely valid.
Check your calculations, cause this is valid.
Come back when you can tell this is valid.
Yep, that one worked for me.
And another one.
Great! Another valid card.
Add that to the list.
Always good to have more.
You're a big help.
I knew we could count on you!
Nice work!
Good job.
I don't know what we'd do without you.
Good catch! Almost used it...
Damn another invalid card...
Sucks, but good to know.
Really, huh? I would have thought it was valid.
Ugh, so many invalid cards.
Valid? 
Thanks for all the help! That's all the cards I have for now. Hope you kept the input so we don't have to check these again!

While searching for secrets of the past, you find a scrap of paper that contains the following information:

`0110111001110010011010000111000001101001011001000100110001001011110100001111`

`June 29, 1902`

Because youâ€™re great at OSINT, you trace this information back to a famous inscription. What is that inscription?

Flag - `byuctf{inscription_with_underscores}`

Note, the flag will not include the name or dates found in the inscription.

``Use flagCheck to input the flag you get from the challenge to get the actual flag``

# REHOSTING

Files can be found here: [HKCERTCTF 2022](https://github.com/hkcert-ctf/CTF-Challenges/tree/main/CTF-2022/03-base64-encryption)

## Challenge Setup
This challenge has no dependecy files and the `chall.py` file should work without any issues.

## Flag
I changed how the challenge gets the flag from environment to opening up the `pwn.college` flag.

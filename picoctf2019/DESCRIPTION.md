## Welcome to picoCTF

True to all picoCTF's before it, picoCTF 2019 excelled at providing helpful learning ramps for people investigating cyber security for the first time, but also provided some difficult challenges to test the saltiest cyber security expert's chops.

The video game aspect of picoCTF 2019 was incredibly well-received and besides a lit soundtrack, it provided mini-games that could unlock super-hints for a handful of challenges.

picoCTF 2019 improved upon the Classroom feature from the previous year, allowing instructors to create up to 20 classrooms and add students quickly using batch registration via a comma separated values file.

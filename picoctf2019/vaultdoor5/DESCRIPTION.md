In the last challenge, you mastered octal (base 8), decimal (base 10), and hexadecimal (base 16) numbers, but this vault door uses a different change of base as well as URL encoding! The source code for this vault is here: VaultDoor5.java

`Use flagCheck to input the flag you get from the challenge to get the actual flag`

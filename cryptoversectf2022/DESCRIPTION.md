## Welcome to Cryptoverse CTF 2022

Cryptoverse CTF 2022 is a beginner-friendly CTF organized by an individual who is particularly interested in Cryptography and Reverse Engineering.

We will focus on both crypto and reverse, with a few miscs for some fun. We aim to present a set of challenges for both beginners and skilled professionals.

There will be a total of 30 challenges during the 30-hour event in crypto, reverse, misc, or a mixture of them. Hope you can have some fun!

Fawkes has been playing around with Finite State Automaton lately. While exploring the concept of implementing regular expressions using FSA he thought of implementing an email-address validator.

Recently, Lua started to annoy Fawkes. To this, Fawkes, challenged Lua to a battle of wits. Fawkes promised to reward Lua, only if she manages to transition to a non-reachable state in the FSA he implemented. The replication can be accessed here.

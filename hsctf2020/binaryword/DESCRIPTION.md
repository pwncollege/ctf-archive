My little brother who is in kindergarten was given this to him by his teacher. He wasn't able to solve it, but can you?

Note: 0 is black, 1 is white. The entire flag is hidden inside the word search, including flag{}. The flag may also be backwards or diagonally hidden.

```Note:``` To view the image, open deskptop mode and open the file through firefox

`Use flagCheck to input the flag you get from the challenge to get the actual flag`

It's late. You finally made it to town after a long day, and you decide to stop at the saloon before calling it a night. You start toward the bar, but suddenly you hear a crash from one of the rooms off to the side. The door is slightly cracked open, and a sliver of light is poking out. You hear the sound of people yelling from behind it. The arguing gets louder as you approach. Just as you peak inside, the door slams open. A man walks out. The room gets quiet. You see a table with money and dice. And now there's an empty seat. Care to make a bet?

### Story

Maybe looking at the user-facing parts of the HQB Multimedia Library was your mistake all along. You glance furtively around, seeing nobody paying attention to you, and slip through a heavy door marked “Librarians only”. A long hallway leads to a room with way more color than you were expecting. A sign above the entrance to the room reads DB. No other explanation. Inside the room, post-its are everywhere with cute animals, cute faces, and cute flags on them. Is this how they keep track of the collection? You think there has to be some problem with this system. Maybe even a problem that tells you about a flag.

`Use flagCheck to input the flag you get from the challenge to get the actual flag`

Pirate Keith loves cryptography and has protected his treasure with a very annoying caesar shift. He has witten “CGULKVIPFRGDOOCSJTRRVMORCQDZG” on his treasure chest and has left a piece of paper with the following message: “every subsequent letter is shifted one less than the previous.” Knowing this, can you unlock Pirate Keith’s treasure chest?

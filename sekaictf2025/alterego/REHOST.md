# REHOSTING

## Challenge Setup
This challenge requires `sage` to be installed, besides that there are no `sage` imports in the file so everything should work out of the box, it has the `functions` it needs in the same folder so if any problem with the import arises, best way would be adding the challenge folder to the `$PATH`.

## Flag
As `pwn.college` does not have a way to access `/flag` within the `sage` file so we use `exec-suid` with `python` using the file generated by `sage`.

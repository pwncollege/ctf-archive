# REHOSTING

Files can be found here: [L3akCTF 2025](https://ctf.l3ak.team/challenges#Basic%20LLL-83)

## Challenge Setup
This challenge requires `sage` to be installed, besides that there are no `sage` imports in the file so everything should work out of the box.

## Flag
As `pwn.college` does not have a way to access `/flag` within the `sage` file so we use `exec-suid` with `python` using the file generated by `sage`.

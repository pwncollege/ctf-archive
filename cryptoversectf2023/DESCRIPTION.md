## Welcome to Cryptoverse CTF 2023

Cryptoverse CTF 2023 is a 36-hour CTF targeted at beginner to intermediate players.

The event will focus on cryptography, reverse engineering, and programming. Based on 2022 feedback, we also created challenges for other categories, including web, forensics, and pwn. We aim to present a set of challenges for both beginners and skilled professionals.

Hope you can have some fun!

Scotty's last signal

You might have heard about Montgomery Scott, the legendary chief engineer of the U.S.S. 
Enterprise. What you probably did not know is his passion for Video Games - especially 
really old classics. We recently lost contact with his transport shuttle and we think 
you should examine this old game file we recently recieved because he might have just 
put a message into there. This would make sense if he could not send a fully blown 
Space-Unicode message signal to avoid attracting any Borg ships in the sector... 
(Borg usually are very bad at video games) His passion for Beaming and Warping 
might be of interest for your analysis.

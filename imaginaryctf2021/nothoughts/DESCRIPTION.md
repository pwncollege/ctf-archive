There's a beautiful solution for No Thoughts, Head Empty, to make the code just print the flag. However, there's a much easier, but much less elegant solution, that I imagine many people found instead. The elegant solution is still there - can you find it in this empty head?

`Use flagCheck to input the flag you get from the challenge to get the actual flag`

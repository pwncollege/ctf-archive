We have been trying to read Bob's emails for 5 years. <br>
We sniffed all his traffic and reversed his POP3 encrypted protocol.<br> 
He is using a good block cipher, CBC mode and unique initialization vectors for each command.<br>
We easily found Alice password and decrypted her mails but we never found the server key or his passwords.<br>
Until one day when Bob had very bad luck and we were able to decrypt all his mails. <br>
Get bobpop.cap, discover what happened and read his mails.<br><br><br>

```
Note: This challenge has not been solved during the ctf.

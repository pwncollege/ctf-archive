## Ghost in the Shellcode 2012

The time draws near for the third annual Ghost in the Shellcode (GitS) Capture the Flag (CTF) event at ShmooCon!

Each year the competition has grown more challenging and this year is no exception. As before the game format will consist of question-and-answer style challenges that are arranged throughout multiple categories, with challenges for both newbies and elite hackers alike. To add to the fun, this years competition will feature a special new category that has never been seen before in any other CTF competition. We think you're going to love it!

To raise the level of competition another notch, this year will also be the first year that GitS CTF will be online so that hackers not attending ShmooCon can also participate in the event. However, most prizes will be limited to the teams that are playing onsite at the conference.

To get a feel for the type of questions you might come across, last year's challenges are online: http://ghostintheshellcode.com

Just to get the juices flowing the GitS CTF will be hosting another online warmup round. As before, the winning prize will be a coveted ShmooCon barcode.

The event will be kicking off at 6pm on January 6th, and will run into 6pm on January 7th, or until all challenges have been solved (last year all challenges were solved, so we thought that was a good excuse
to add more this year).

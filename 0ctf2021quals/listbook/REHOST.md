# REHOSTING

Link to files: [0CTF 2021 Quals](https://github.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/blob/main/ctfs/0CTF/2021/Quals/crypto/zer0lfsr/task.py)

## Challenge Setup
The file `listbook` has a dependency of `libc-2.31.so` which has been included but since the libc file already exists there is no need of patching.

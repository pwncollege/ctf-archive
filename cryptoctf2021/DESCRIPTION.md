## Welcome to Crypto CTF 2021

Crypto CTF is an online competition for hackers to test, evaluate, and expand their cryptography exploiting skills. In this CTF we will provide various crypto challenges regarding modern cryptography techniques.
All crypto lovers are most welcome!
CryptoCTF is a revenge for everlasting complaints by CTF participants about crypto challenges in CTF contests. In this brand-new tournament we are trying to provide the crypto lovers with fun and challenging pure crypto tasks to squeeze their heart and test their passion for cryptography.
Each task will be based on a particular cryptographic primitive, or it will include a direct application of cryptography in other fields.
The organizers of these tournaments generously offer their skills knowledge to design original Crypto tasks and challenges for similar contests.

Long Live Crypto :)

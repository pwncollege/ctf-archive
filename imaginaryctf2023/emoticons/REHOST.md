## Challenge Setup
There are no dependency files for `gen.py` or `out.txt`.

## Flag Check

As this challenge has its own custom flag so we use a simple flag check binary where the hacker can input the challenge flag and get the pwn.college flag. Command to run flag check-
```
/challenge/flagcheck
```

Tracking down pictures can be hard. Surely you can't find where this giant ballpark is...

Submit your flag as ictf{latitude,longitude}, with the coordinates of where the picture was taken rounded to three decimal places. Example: ictf{-42.443,101.333}

**Note:** To view the .png, go to desktop mode and open the file with firefox

`Use flagCheck to input the flag you get from the challenge to get the actual flag`
